## The Problem

Steam's game recording feature on Linux captures **all system audio** by default—everything playing through your speakers gets recorded:

❌ System notifications  
❌ Browser audio (YouTube, Spotify, etc.)  
❌ Discord/chat applications  
❌ Background applications  

This results in cluttered recordings with unwanted sounds mixing into your gameplay footage.

## The Solution

**Steam Audio Isolator** creates **direct audio connections** from your game to Steam's recording input, completely bypassing the system audio mixer:

```
❌ WITHOUT Steam Audio Isolator:
   Game → Audio Sink (speakers) → Steam Recording
       ↳ Browser, Discord, notifications also recorded

✓ WITH Steam Audio Isolator:
   Game → Direct Connection → Steam Recording
   Other Audio → Speakers (not recorded)
```

## Features

### Core Functionality
- 🎮 **Automatic Game Detection** - Detects Wine/Proton and native Linux games

  - **Games**: Wine, Proton, native executables
  - **Browsers**: Firefox, Chrome, Chromium, Brave, Vivaldi, Edge, Safari
  - **Communication**: Discord, Slack, Zoom, Telegram, Teams, Skype
  - **System**: ALSA, PulseAudio, notification daemons
  - **Applications**: Everything else
- 🔗 **Direct Audio Routing** - Creates point-to-point PipeWire connections, bypassing the audio sink
- 🎵 **Multi-Stream Support** - Handles games with multiple audio streams (main, UI, voice)

## Installation

### Option 1: Download Standalone Binary (Recommended)

**No Python installation required!** Just download and run.

1. Go to [Releases](https://github.com/crashman79/steam-audio-isolator/releases)
2. Download `steam-audio-isolator-linux-x86_64.tar.gz`
3. Extract and install:
   ```bash
   tar -xzf steam-audio-isolator-linux-x86_64.tar.gz
   cd steam-audio-isolator-linux-x86_64
   ./install.sh
   ```
4. Launch from application menu or terminal: `steam-audio-isolator`

### Option 2: Run from Source

```bash
git clone https://github.com/crashman79/steam-audio-isolator.git
cd steam-audio-isolator
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
python -m steam_pipewire.main
```

### Option 3: Build Standalone Binary (For Developers)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/crashman79/steam-audio-isolator.git
cd steam-audio-isolator
pip install -r requirements.txt pyinstaller
chmod +x build_release.sh
./build_release.sh

# Release tarball will be in dist/
```

### Requirements

- **Linux** with PipeWire audio system (not PulseAudio)
- **Python 3.8+** (if running from source)
- **Steam** with game recording enabled

## Quick Start

### Step 1: Start the Application
- Launch from application menu or terminal: `steam-audio-isolator`
- App auto-detects all PipeWire audio sources

### Step 2: Select Audio Sources
1. Go to **Audio Routing** tab
2. Game sources are auto-detected and auto-selected
3. **Uncheck** system, browser, and other non-game sources
4. See your selection highlighted in the list

### Step 3: Apply Routing
1. Click **"✓ Apply Routing"** button
2. Watch the **Current Routes** tab update in real-time
3. You'll see the routes visualization diagram show your connections

### Step 4: Start Recording in Steam
1. Press Steam's recording hotkey (default: **Ctrl+F11**)
2. Only your selected game audio is captured!
3. Verify in the **Current Routes** tab that connections are active

### Step 5: When Done
- Click **"✕ Clear All Routes"** to disconnect
- App restores default routing (if "Restore default on close" is enabled)

## How It Works

### Detection & Categorization
The app analyzes each PipeWire node's properties to categorize sources:

1. **Check process binary** (wine, proton, firefox, etc.)
2. **Check application name** (Discord, Slack, Zoom, etc.)
3. **Check media class** (Stream/Output/Audio = audio producer)
4. **Exclude system nodes** (dummy drivers, echo cancellation, ALSA, Pulse)

### Routing
When you click "Apply Routing":

1. Finds the Steam recording node (auto-discovered)
2. Removes any existing audio sink → Steam connections (to prevent double-recording)
3. Creates direct **game audio → Steam** connections using `pw-cli create-link`
4. System audio continues to speakers normally
5. Updates the visualization diagram in real-time

### Cleanup
When you click "Clear All Routes":

1. Disconnects all game audio from Steam
2. Optionally reconnects the audio sink (for default behavior)
3. All audio returns to speakers

## Technical Details

### Source Detection
- **Games**: Detects Wine, Proton executables and native Linux games
- **Browsers**: Firefox, Chrome, Chromium, Opera, Brave, Edge, Vivaldi, Safari
- **Communication**: Discord, Slack, Zoom, Telegram, Teams, Skype, Mumble, TeamSpeak
- **System**: System daemons, notification systems
- **Filtering**: Automatically excludes echo-cancel nodes, dummy drivers, internal systems

### Node Structure
- **Audio Sink** (e.g., Node 66): Your speaker/headphone hardware
- **Game Node** (e.g., Node 137): Audio output from your game
- **Steam Node** (e.g., Node 154): Steam's recording input

### Why Direct Routing Works
- ✓ Selective: Only chosen sources connect to Steam
- ✓ Dual playback: Game audio goes to speakers AND Steam simultaneously
- ✓ Clean: No system audio in your recording
- ✓ Reversible: Easy to restore default routing anytime
- ✓ Real-time: Changes take effect instantly

### PipeWire Commands Used
```bash
pw-dump                              # Query all nodes and connections
pw-cli create-link                   # Create audio routing connection
pw-cli destroy <link_id>             # Remove routing connection
pw-cli list-objects Link             # View active connections
```

### Configuration Storage
```
~/.config/steam-audio-isolator/
├── settings.json                    # Application settings
└── profiles/
    ├── game-only.pwp               # Saved routing profiles
    ├── game-discord.pwp
    └── ...

~/.cache/steam-audio-isolator.log   # Debug logs
```

## Troubleshooting

### "Steam node not found"
**Cause**: Steam's recording input isn't detected  
**Solutions**:
- Ensure Steam is running
- Enable **Game Recording** in Steam settings for your game
- Verify PipeWire is running: `systemctl --user status wireplumber`
- Check Steam node exists: `pw-dump | grep -i steam`
- Click **Refresh Sources** in the app

### "No audio sources detected"
**Cause**: Game not started or PipeWire issue  
**Solutions**:
- Start your game **before** launching the app
- Check PipeWire is running: `systemctl --user status wireplumber`
- Verify tools are installed: `which pw-dump pw-cli`
- Click **Refresh Sources** (F5) button
- Check logs: `~/.cache/steam-audio-isolator.log`

### Routes not appearing in "Current Routes"
**Solutions**:
- Click **Refresh Routes** button in Current Routes tab
- Check **System Info** tab for node IDs
- Verify with: `pw-cli list-objects Link`

### Audio still being captured (unwanted sources)
**Problem**: System sounds or browser audio in recording  
**Solution**:
1. Go to **Audio Routing** tab
2. Uncheck any system, browser, or non-game sources
3. Keep only game sources checked
4. Click **Apply Routing** again

### Game audio plays but doesn't record in Steam
**Solutions**:
- Press Steam's recording hotkey (default: **Ctrl+F11**)
- Verify Steam Game Recording is enabled per-game in Steam settings
- Check audio is working in speakers first
